    "review": "Jackie Chan's first starring role, also known as The Cub Tiger from Kwang Tung. Jackie was only 17 here and it shows. I couldn't find a very good copy of this, and I believe the DVD I got was converted from the 35mm real to digital video by literally projecting it on a wall then filming the projected image. Many of the subtitles are illegible, but it doesn't matter because the plot is simple to a fault. In fact, there are almost no stakes in the movie. There's no explanation for why this gang keeps coming after Jackie. He's just a waiter at a noodle shop that wants nothing to do with them. There are a few good scenes, like Jackie's dad throwing a bunch of potted plants at him, and a few terrible scenes, like the rape, but overall the choreography is very bad, which makes it pretty much valuless as anything other than a time capsule. Tien Feng is fantastic as always.",

    "review": "I watched the severely edited 1980 version of this film, but I don't think the original would have been much better. The problem is that they hadn't figured out how to use Jackie yet. Though he is a bit smarmy there's basically no comedy to his character. Also the fights are bland and few of them even showcase Jackie. This was actually a sequel to \"Fist of Fury\" which starred Bruce Lee. Lo Wei was trying to recapture the success he'd had with Lee and it didn't pay off. The setup of the plot is actually good. Japan has occupied Taiwan and set up a karate school which serves as the villain. Then it becomes a showdown between karate and kung fu, which sounds cool but doesn't really pay off. There's a part where Jackie holds a sign over his head and walks triumphantly down the street that's pretty effective. It's almost messianic imagery. The ending is probably the most hilarious Chan freeze-frame on record.",

    "review": "For an early film, Shaolin Wooden Men has a lot of directorial flair. There are many scenes that made me scream out loud with either terror or laughter. Chen Chi Hwa used a ludicrous amount of camera pans and zooms to sell the zaniness. The plot is cool, but not mold breaking. It gets quite predictable near the end. The upside is that this film is almost entirely training or fighting scenes, and each scene has a really neat visual concept. In one Jackie's master constructs a little device out of bamboo to spar with him because he's chained to a wall. It includes a foot pedal that hits Jackie in the groin. In another Jackie does an early iteration of his famous drunken boxing. Then there is the fight against the titular wooden men, which doesn't disappoint. The film's one real downside is a big one, unfortunately. Some of the actors in the movie can not fight, and it shows. In the widely available cut, and the one I watched, some of the action is edited to make it appear faster, but it was horribly done. Overall though, Shaolin Wooden Men is a very good time.",

It's a nice style, and ther's plenty of actual fight choreography to back it up, but it doesn't have much thought to it. They're mostly relying on the special effects to carry the film, which they don't quite accomplish. There are a few shocking and funny moments, but none that are intended as comedy. Even though there's never any subtext, the plot still manages to be confusing. Even Jackie himself said as much in one of his books. I liked the mystical qualities of the movie, and I liked some of the characters. There's a great woman that follows Chan around the whole time and torments him. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much pleasure for the Chan fans as he's truly underutilized here, and showcases none of his signature charn.",

The plot is bulletproof \u2014 just enough to build tension, but not enough to get bogged down in. The supporting characters and cast, though they are numerous, are all uniquely wonderful. Jackie is used perfectly here. His character is arrogant and always cracking wise. Those traits are motivated and grounded by the mysterious plot. The Kung Fu is fantastic, and if Jackie weren't missing from a significant portion of it later in the film then this might have been a more perfect score.",

This certainly shows through much of the film. The fights are mostly not up to the Chan standard. There are several scenes that are pretty charming and throw back to the original film such as Jackie getting a job. Chan's co-star actually has an interesting character as well. He's lazy and so creates machines to do things like make him breakfast. This comes into play at the end of the film when he constructs a series of elaborate traps. It's a satisfying payoff.

The action scenes are spectacular and the set pieces are even better. The climax is an absolutely classic stunt. Unfortunately there's a lot of crazy Scooby Doo hijinx in the middle that don't work well and go on for literally a half hour. I timed it. There are so many characters that everything goes off the rails. It feels like the film originally had nothing to do with Project A but the studio decided they could get more money with some brand recognition. I want to like this more than I did.",

Jennifer Love Hewitt is his co-star, and though I usually don't have a problem with her, she's horrendous here. She just cannot do wacky comedy. It's like the movie was just trying to slot her in as another Chris Tucker or Owen Wilson and the results are embarrassing. Unfortunately, the film doesn't even offer much in the way of action or fights as it's almost all replaced with CG and wire-work. The plot is absolutely bananas and there are almost Batman and Robin (Schumacher) vibes. I only wish that Chan had been better used here so that the plot could be funny in context instead of just uninteresting. The first act is OK and centers around Jackie driving a cab and trying to ask a girl on a date then becoming a secret agent's valet, but after that it was all downhill. Also James brown is in this movie for some reason.",

One of the worst parts is the humor. Jackie's partner here is the least funny and most obnoxious of any of his teamups. I honestly didn't think it could get worse than Jennifer Love Hewitt. Jackie is severely underutilized since almost all the action is effect-based. There's no entertainment to be had here, only frustration. There's a scene where Jackie's love interest gets into a fight with the villain's female henchman and a cat yowl is literally dubbed over it.",

The battle scenes, however, are terrible except for when they stray in to the hilariously absurd. Perhaps the most entertaining character is Chan's trusty horse Black Wind who does much of Chan's fighting for him. This is a hard movie to rate. For example, it has lots of terrible CGI, but much of it falls into \"so bad it's good\" territory, and there are also many fantastic practical effects. Sometimes the direction is just baffling. I'm almost certain that in the largest battle sequence they couldn't get Jackie on set at the same time as all the extras (probably out with an injury) and so they just green-screened him in and threw some dust over every shot to try to hide it. The editing moves along at lightspeed the whole time, which I technically hate, but I'm almost thankful for it here as it gets me through the lows and into the next highlight quicker. Thanks to this I found myself laughing most of the time.  ",

The problem with this is that, though Chan's character is likeable, everything he does and everything that happens to him is predictable to a hilarious degree (literally laugh-out-loud funny). The plot of Dragon Blade is therefore extremely simplistic. The part that I do appreciate is the bromance between Chan and Cusack that flowers as they work together to repair a city that was seiged at some point. That was never explained, or if it was it was during a brief expository flashback, the same way as the rest of the plot. Cusack and Brody are both alternating between way over the top and phoning it in depending on the scene. There are a few genuinely fun scenes that consist of quality Jackie action, and some wildly weird visuals (a corpse being held upright by the many arrows stuck in his back), but I don't think I will ever enjoy the Honor Porn genre.",
